Computes conservation based habitat scores to aid in preferential selection for conservation espeically when resources are limited. The scores compute incorporates the species threat levels, rarity, richness, and habitat surface area. The smaller a habitat with threatened species which are endemic the higher the higher scores. Surface area was also incorporated as a proxy for financial constraint to select habitats are cost-effective to manage in case of limited resources.

## Installation

Install the recent version from Github

``` r
#For windows operating system
#
install.packages('remotes)

install_github("AnthonyBasooma/conspriorityr")

#Mac
remotes::install_github("AnthonyBasooma/conspriorityr@HEAD")

```

## Conservaation 

Prioritizing the conservation of waterbodies in the Lake Kyoga system in Uganda


```{r libraries}

library(conspriorityr) #compute priority scores
library(sf) #to handle the vector data/maps

## basic example code





```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
