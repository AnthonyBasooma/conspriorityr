Description: Computes priority scores to aid in preferential selection of habitats
    for conservation, espeically when resources are limited. The scores computed incorporates
    the species threat status, rarity, richness, and habitat surface area. Small
    habitats with threatened species which are endemic will have high scores. 
    Surface area was incorporated as a proxy for financial requirements to ensure cost-effectiveness
    while prioritizing a particular habitat for conservation.
